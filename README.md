desert-rust-meetup
==================

A place for the files of the Desert Rust Meetup. A meetup in Phoenix, AZ for the Rust programming language.



## If you are new to Rust:

The easiest installation of Rust and Cargo that I have found is at [https://crates.io/](https://crates.io/install). It is titled "Install Cargo", but it also installs the most recent build of Rust.

If you'd like to play with Rust without the installation of any software other than a browser. Then 
[http://play.rust-lang.org/](http://play.rust-lang.org/) would be very useful.
