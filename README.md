desert-rust-meetup
==================

A place for the files of the Desert Rust Meetup. A meetup in Phoenix, AZ for the Rust programming language.



## If you are new to Rust:

The Rust Compiler and it's package manage Cargo can be downloaded from [http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html).

If you'd like to play with Rust without the installation of any software other than a browser. Then 
[http://play.rust-lang.org/](http://play.rust-lang.org/) would be very useful.
